# Image compare

Created this program to help me go through a bunch of image files I recovered from a hard drive. got a lot of duplicates so this tool is to move all the duplicates to a different folder.

## Usage

Open the python file and edit the path variable to the folder you want it to go tough

you have to use "/" in the file path not "\"

## Example

```python
path = "c:/some/path"
```
